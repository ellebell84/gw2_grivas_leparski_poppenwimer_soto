 OVERVIEW
 
 PROJECT PART 2: HTML5 Coded Webpage - Convert to a Responsive Page
 
DESCRIPTION:
Using the site you created in Group Work 1, you will use media queries to convert the page into a responsive site.
You MUST use external CSS exclusively for formatting.
Cross-browser check.
Make sure to always check your page in your browser, as well as a backup browser.
Decisions on how to place content at different browser widths is completely up to you. Youâ€™ll want to be sure your page looks good from 320px wide and up.

REQUIRED ELEMENTS:
Convert all static widths to responsive units of your choice (percentages are recommended)
Convert all font sizes to rems or ems
Ensure all images are responsive (hint: the max-width property is your friend!)
Use media queries to address breakpoints and move site content for easier viewing at smaller sizes
