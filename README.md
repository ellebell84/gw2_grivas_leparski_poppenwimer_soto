 HTML5 Coded Webpage - Convert to a Responsive Page
 
DESCRIPTION
Using the site you created in Group Work 1, you will use media queries to convert the page into a responsive site.
You MUST use external CSS exclusively for formatting.
Cross-browser check.
Make sure to always check your page in your browser, as well as a backup browser.
Decisions on how to place content at different browser widths is completely up to you. You’ll want to be sure your page looks good from 320px wide and up.
Since you’re converting a page, you don’t have to exclusively use min-width media queries. It’s likely that you’ll have a combination of max-width and min-width queries to achieve the look you want without having to overhaul all of the CSS you’ve already written.

DIRECTIONS
You will be split up into groups.
Each group must share their mics to communicate.
You must equitably divide the work (HTML5 and CSS)
Your instructor will be checking in throughout the allowed time.

GRADE YOUR GROUP MEMBERS
You must submit a grade for each group member based on your opinion of their participation.
These grades will be private from each group member; only your Instructor will view them.
